* Requirements for Federated Identity management

* Why we need it?
  - Integrating third party service, having standarized
  - Offer a service, 
    - without authentication
    - in order to use this, you need some authentication
      only authenticated users can have access to this service.
      - build my own authentication
      - use other 

  - Every server needs authentication

  - Every request that comes to the server is forwarded

* The mechanism of doing it

  1. c ---------> server -------> a
  2. c:(u, c) -------> s
  3. s: is_authorized (u, c)
  4. s: S, u, c ----------> a
  5. a authenticates u on c
  6. a: ----------> is authenticated S
  7. s: allow u
