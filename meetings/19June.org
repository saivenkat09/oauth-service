* Reasons for Oauth system to be developed by us.
- Delegated authentication mechanism.


* Questions
** Microservice
- building microservice based system, authentication is another service.
- working with the assumption that already authenticated
- From a building perspective.
- User is an id, store all the data in a db table.




* Why we need it

** Use Cases
- 3rd party services.
- User Flow wth user agent
- Server-Server Flow with 'server agent'


** User Flow   

Client ----> Server
u, c requests s;
is_authorized(u, c)
s, u, c requests a
a evaluates
a returns true or false to s.
s says allow u


* Building
- Engineering decision: do we build it? 


* What to do now.
- Authenticate all microservices in VLABS, server-server flow 
- new service has a service configuration specification / config file.
Should have all the keys and all that.
- 

1) take a service, make it register with google and have s1, s2 register with
   google and have them register with google and get the triangle system
   working. 
2) Apply to cluster
3) Verify in cloud server, if EDX there then.
