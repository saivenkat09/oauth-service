** Diagrams

[[./diagrams/normalAuthFlow.jpg][Normal Authentication Flow]]

[[./diagrams/jwtAuthFlow.jpg][Proposed Authentication Flow via JWT]]


** Description

- Create a Sample system using jwt to provide authorization.

  system(main thing to be created). It's based on the second diagram.

- *Aim*: To test the creation and passing of a jwt token with limited
  information. 

  
** DONE Needed

*** Micro-service

- Needed to experiment with. The decryption of the JWT must take place at the
  microservice itself thus a sample is needed for testing.

- Dashboard?

  
** Additional Information Still Needed

- What level of security needs to be maintained.

- How much information will be needed to be sent in the packets, and currently
  where are the microservices receiving the information from(for the sake of
  emulation)

- Security Analysis of using only JWT, vs Oauth also inside.
