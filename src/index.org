* Aim
- To Build a Oauth Service to that allows authorization between microservices
  and to have an authentication service for the user.


* Problem
- There are multiple services sitting on different servers. As a result
  authorization is required between the services. 


* Solution
In a nutshell: Be able to create a system where you can  "Login with VLABS
Account" for each of the services.


* Process

** DONE Implementing it on a small scale.
- Trying to create a small version of an oauth service. (Looking for open
  source solutions)

** TODO Increasing Complexity of the System.

** Integrating with Outreach Portal
