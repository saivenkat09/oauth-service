  Following diagram represents the oauth-service design.
  This diagram has the following 3 sections:
  1) *Oauth Service* : A Micro Service which provides the authentication
     information via =REST= API's
  2) *Idp Service* : A Identity Provider which
     manages all the users authentication. Also provides the
     google authentication for user to login and logout.
  3) *Micro Services* : S1 and S2 are microservices which belong to vlabs.
  4) *User* : Person using microservices and needs to be authenticated.
