* Introduction
  The application or the system is abstracted as the data model.  The model
  captures: the entities that comprise the system; relations and constraints
  between these entities; and operations that entail a change in the state of
  the system.

* Authenticating with Google  
  We have successfully modelled the SAML flow between the Google and our Oauth Server in the Alloy Models.
  [[./Alloy_Models][Alloy Model]]

* Autherizing microservices 
** Work Flow  
   1.User opens in a microservice
   2.As the user isn't authenticated with the service he is redirected to the Oauth Server
   3.The User Authenticates is redirected to the microService
   4.The User uses the Micro Service(S1) and then decides to use the Second MicroService(S2)
   5.S2 checks with the Oauth Service whether the user is authenticated.
   6.As the User is Authenticated he is allowed to use the S2

* Notation
  The system is defined as the data model.  There is a certain notation that is
  used defining the data model. 

** Sets, cardinality and relations

If =A= is a set, then
    1. =A!= denotes exactly one element of =A=.
    2. =A?= denotes at most one element of =A=.
    3. =A+= denotes  one or more elements of =A=
    4. =A*=  denotes at zero or more elements of =A=.  Often
       abbreviated as =A=.
    5. =A > B= denotes a relation /from/ =A= /to/ =B=.

** Relations and their cardinality type

A relation =r:A > B= could relate each element of =A= to
zero, one or more elements of =B=.

|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| Cardinality of B               | Notation  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least zero elements of =B=. | r: A > B  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at most one element of =B=     | r: A > B? |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least one element of =B=    | r: A > B+ |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| exactly one element of =B=     | r: A > B! |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|

** Example of Entity Relationship notation
    
#+begin_example
 [email, user] : User? > Email!
#+end_example

Encodes the following items of information:

 - =email= is a relation /from/ the set =User= /to/ the set
   =Email=.

 - =User= is called the /domain/ of the relation =email=.

 - =Email= is called the /codomain/ of the relation =email=.

 - The relation =email= relates each element of =User= to
   /exactly one/ element of =Email=.  This is written as 

 #+begin_example
 email: User > Email!
 #+end_example

 - =user= is a relation /from/ the set =Email= /to/ the set
   =User=.

 - =Email= is called the /domain/ of the relation =user=.

 - =User= is called the /codomain/ of the relation =user=.

 - The relation =user= relates each element of =Email= to
   /at most one/ element of =User=.  This is written as 

 #+begin_example
 user: Email > User?
 #+end_example

* Abstract Entity Types
