* Oauth Serivce

Aim is to create a service which can provide authorization between
microservices at VLEAD and can potentially provide authentication of the user.

We have used CAS(Common Authentication System) to create this service.

* Setup 
For getting started do:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make readtheorg=true -k all
firefox ./build/docs/index.html
#+END_EXAMPLE
    
* Important links
** Run application on developement environment
   Use [[./src/deployment/index.org][Documentation]] to setup and run the application on
   local/development environment.

** API documentation
   Visit [[./src/vlead-cas-overlay/index.org][link]] for API documentation

** Changes in VLEAD microservices code
	We have created a demo application in flask to show how to setup microservices for CAS.
	Visit  [[./src/client/index.org][link]] to understand the diffrence in the implementation
