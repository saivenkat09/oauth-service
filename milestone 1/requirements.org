* CANCELED Requirements

** Diagrams

[[./diagrams/normalAuthFlow.jpg][Normal Authentication Flow]]

[[./diagrams/jwtAuthFlow.jpg][Proposed Authentication Flow via JWT]]


** Description

- Create a Sample system using jwt to provide authorization.

- Will involve a single micro-service, the outreach portal, and auth
  system(main thing to be created). It's based on the second diagram.

- *Aim*: To test the creation and passing of a jwt token with limited
  information. 

  
** DONE Needed

*** Micro-service

- Needed to experiment with. The decryption of the JWT must take place at the
  microservice itself thus a sample is needed for testing.

- Dashboard?

  
** Additional Information Still Needed

- What level of security needs to be maintained.

- How much information will be needed to be sent in the packets, and currently
  where are the microservices receiving the information from(for the sake of
  emulation)

- Security Analysis of using only JWT, vs Oauth also inside.

 




* TODO Update on Requirements
** Creating oauth service(login with vlabs)
- Using open source software / building own, we should be able to create a
  login with vlabs feature(currently outreach uses login with google)

* TODO Work Now 

** TODO Create a diagram for flow of data

** TODO Get the outreach portal repository and analyze the application's current auth system to see where I can insert my own.

** TODO Make changes in outreach portal to integrate it with a new auth system

* TODO Things to look in to 
** SAML key
