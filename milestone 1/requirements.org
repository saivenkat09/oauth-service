* Requirements

** Diagrams

[[./normalAuthFlow.jpg][Normal Authentication Flow]]

[[./jwtAuthFlow.jpg][Proposed Authentication Flow via JWT]]






** Description

- Create a Sample system using jwt to provide authorization.

- Will involve a single micro-service, simple html "dashboard", and auth
  system(main thing to be created). It's based on the second diagram.

- *Aim*: To test the creation and passing of a jwt token with limited
  information. 


** TODO Needed

*** Micro-service

- Needed to experiment with. The decryption of the JWT must take place at the
  microservice itself thus a sample is needed for testing.

- 

** Additional Information Still Needed

- What level of security needs to be maintained.

- How much information will be needed to be sent in the packets, and currently
  where are the microservices receiving the information from(for the sake of
  emulation)
